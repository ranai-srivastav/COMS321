# COMS321: Computer Architecture

This is a repository for all my code for COMS 321 at Iowa State University. This contains a couple of coding projects I did for that class
- Assembly code that sorts number using Insertion sort
- JAVA code that decompiles the binary from binary that is generated after compiling the assembly file back into assembly
